So when is that?</p><h2 id=h-the-25th-anniversary data-injectable=false>The 25th Anniversary</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Grand-Theft-Auto-5-Trevor-Michael-Franklin-e1699438377863.jpg><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Rockstar Games was established in December 1998 as a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive. It doesn’t seem that there’s an official date for its formation, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2018 the company celebrated its 20th anniversary on Dec. 10</a>, so that’s as good a date as any.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>Dan and Sam Houser founded the company in collaboration with BMG Interactive’s Terry Donovan, Arista Records’ Gary Foreman, and Take-Two’s Jamie King, with the intention that it would become Take-Two’s “high-end” publishing label. Given Rockstar’s monstrous global success, I think it’s safe to say they succeeded.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>So what can we expect for their 25th anniversary celebrations? Our best guess comes from a look back at their 20th anniversary celebrations in 2018. That saw a range of new merchandise related to the then-new Red Dead Redemption 2, a month-long sale on other merchandise and deep discounts in the “Rockstar Classics” games in their back catalogue.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=false>We’d expect something similar for its 25th, but a trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI would inevitably suck up all the publicity in the gaming industry for some time to come. We can’t wait to get an official look at this game, as after the high-profile leaks, hacks, and endless speculation, it’d be great to know some concrete details.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorqGdnmK2tHnRqJqkq6SWv26zwKacrGViasGpecCnpaKulafAor7YaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-are-kettle-chips.html><span>←</span><span>What Are Kettle Chips? | Sporked</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
