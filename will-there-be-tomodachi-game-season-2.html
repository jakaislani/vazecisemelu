In 2017, Tomodachi Game had already been adapted into a live-action series and two live-action films. And the same year the anime came out, the live-action episodic adaptation Tomodachi Game R4 was also released."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In 2017, Tomodachi Game had already been adapted into a live-action series and two live-action films. And the same year the anime came out, the live-action episodic adaptation Tomodachi Game R4 was also released.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Does this prolific tendency to adapt the story mean there’s hope for the anime to return for a second season?</p><h2 id=h-the-silence-continues data-injectable=false>The silence continues</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tomodachi-43.jpg><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>By the second half of 2023, the time of this writing, there still hadn’t been any news regarding the continuation of Tomodachi Game. That makes it over a year of silence and uncertainty.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>The show’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performance with the public</a> wasn’t outstanding enough to warrant a continuation. It comparatively got overshadowed by the sequel seasons of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Classroom of the Elite</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Overlord</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Made in Abyss</a>, and other new titles like Call of the Night and Lycoris Recoil.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>Looking online, many fans consider season 1 as a ploy to draw more attention toward the source material, which is not an unusual thing. This source material is also coming close to ending, and hence, they also do not expect a follow-up season to be announced.</p><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=29 data-injectable=false>As a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan and Redditor wrote</a>:</p><p>“It probably won’t happen. Shows are there to boost manga sales and the manga is around a year or two from ending so by the time a new season is made the manga will be finished. Plus, the show didn’t perform well enough for a second season.”</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=false>Therefore, while it is not a hundred percent certain that Tomodachi Game season 2 won’t happen, the odds are not in its favor. Fans who wish to know what comes after that nasty cliffhanger the anime ends on, will have to resort to diving into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">manga</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9aio6VlpJ2ys7GMm5xmrJ%2BivKWtwqGgZp%2BRorJuv8SaqqimXWd8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toni-morrison-the-pieces-i-am-2019.html><span>←</span><span>Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am movie review (2019)</span></a>
