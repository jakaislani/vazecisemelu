They’re custardy, salty, packed with protein, and they don’t rely on bread to be filling—a perfect breakfast to go with that perfectly mediocre latte or Americano. Ideally, the best store bought egg bites would taste exactly like that little two-pack from Starbucks, but I was extremely dubious that would be the case.&nbsp;</p><p>See, there are a couple of kinds of egg bites. The baked ones are like crap you could make at home—scramble up some eggs, pour them into a muffin tin, put them in the oven. When I want an egg bite, I want a sous vide egg bite, the kind that’s vacuum sealed and cooked in water. That’s how you get an egg bite that’s nice and custardy rather than one that’s like a dense little egg muffin. It was a revelation to discover that a lot of the microwaveable egg bites you’ll find at the grocery store have a texture that’s almost identical to the sous vide bites at Starbys. I was kind of freaking out during this taste test. We tried a bunch of brands (and a lot of what we tried was really good), but these are the best egg bites we tasted.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

They have a strong vegetal flavor from the spinach, as well as a really pleasant pop of herbs. I couldn’t put a finger on it at first—is that oregano? Or thyme? Close. It’s herbs de Provence! Very chic and a really nice counterpart to the sharp bite of the feta cheese. In general, I preferred the egg bites with a little meat in the mix (meat just contributes so much flavor), but these are a good option for ovo-lacto vegetarians. They have that lovely, custard-like texture. As I wrote in my notes, “I can’t imagine making something better than this from scratch.” Who has the counter space for a sous vide machine?&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best egg bites" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_EGG_BITES_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Denver Omelet Dupe</p><strong>Hormel Black Label Oven-Baked Eggs, Ham, Bell Peppers & 3 Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I love a Denver omelet, and I gotta say that throwing a couple of these bad boys in the microwave is a hell of a lot easier than making one at home—and you still get all that good ham, pepper, and cheese flavor. The ham is salty and the cheese is creamy. The green bell peppers don’t contribute texture or crunch, but they do add a lot of nice, garden-fresh flavor. And the lack of crunch is fine since these are pleasantly smooth and fluffy. I didn’t know if a big brand like Hormel could pull this off, but they did it.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best egg bites" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_EGG_BITES_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Bacon</p><strong>Three Bridges Uncured Bacon & Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Our Best of the Best egg bites (see below) also contain bacon, but these have more bacon. If you like a bite with a high meat-to-egg ratio, you’ll like these Three Bridges egg bites. They’re salty, smoky, and extremely tasty right out the microwave. So many of these are great because you don’t really have to futz with additional seasoning. They’re ready to eat. Three Bridges nails that custard-like consistency, too. These will save you a trip to Starbucks.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best egg white egg bites" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_EGG_BITES_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Egg White</p><strong>Three Bridges Spinach & Bell Pepper Egg White</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>If you’re watching your cholesterol or avoiding egg yolks for other reasons (hey, maybe you just don’t like them?), Three Bridges makes the best egg white egg bites we tried.

The silky texture is the biggest feat. They’re literally perfect after a quick 40-second spin in the microwave.
