<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Magic in `Moulin Rouge' | Festivals &amp;amp; Awards</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>From <a href=#>Baz Luhrmann</a>, the film's director: "We develop a new cinematic language every 10 years, and today, when every kid has a digital camera and is familiar with the conventions of naturalism, it is time to return to the grander styles of the cinema's past."</p><p>From <a href=#>Ewan McGregor</a>, who plays the writer: "It was important that, in the middle of the whirlwind, his character and Kidman's remain focused on the truth of their relationship."</p><p>From <a href=#>John Leguizamo</a>, who plays Toulouse-Lautrec: "I walked on artificial legs that were fitted to my knees, to make me 4 feet 11 inches tall, exactly his height. Because Toulouse was born to first cousins, there were a lot of things wrong with him. His tongue was very thick, and he had a high-pitched lisp. His legs were very short. He was, however, unusually well-endowed, which is why his nickname was the Tripod."</p><p>An interview with <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> was scheduled for after lunch. At the hotel's Eden Roc Restaurant, where Miramax's Harvey Weinstein was table-hopping, there was much talk about whether "middle America" would go for the movie. Also some gloom.</p><p>"Do they know what a musical is?" asked one studio rep.</p><p>"Do they know where Paris is?" asked another.</p><p>"Do they know what Paris is?" asked a third.</p><p>My answer to all three questions: They will not have found out from the movies you have been making for them.</p><p>After lunch, a seance with the tall and regal <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a>. "What a party that was," she said. "We partied all night."</p><p>You look fresh and relaxed, I said.</p><p>"I am an actress."</p><p>Soon I was back at my beloved Hotel Splendid. For the price of lunch at the du Cap, one can stay for a week at the Splendid, breakfast included. The hotel, alas, is not in a serene location, but located directly across the street from the beach with the giant party tents. On the stairs I ran into Ken Turan, film critic of the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>"Grumble, grumble," he said.</p><p>Are you grumbling?</p><p>"Do you know how late that '<a href=#>Moulin Rouge</a>' party lasted last night?" he asked. "I'll tell you. It lasted until 4 a.m."</p><p>You were there until the end?</p><p>"I never left my room."</p><p>It was loud, we agreed, but not as loud as three years ago, when an Austin Powers billboard was erected directly beneath our windows, and broadcast the cackles of a sneering villain 24 hours a day. It takes men of steel to cover the festival. You can't just sit around on your tripod.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52jqba3rcusZqaZl56wbrXNZqSorZyeu26%2Bzq6eng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erica-gluck-net-worth-143294.html><span>←</span><span>Erica Gluck Net Worth</span></a>
