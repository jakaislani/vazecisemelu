According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Oosthuzien’s net worth is as high as $20 million, earned through his successful golfing career, which has been active since 2002.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=louis-oosthuizen-net-worth-20-million></span>Louis Oosthuizen Net Worth $20 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Louis started playing golf at a very young age and through his early amateur years, was supported by countryman Ernie Els, through the Ernie Els and Fancourt Foundation. During his amateur career, Louis won several trophies, including the World Junior Championship, All African Games, Irish Amateur Open Championship, and Natal Open Stroke Play Championship, among others, collecting six trophies overall.</p><p>Louis turned professional in 2002, but didn’t have any major success in the first two years of his professional career, until in 2004 he won Vodacom Origins of Golf Tour at Arabella, on the Sunshine tour. Three years later, Louis really hit form, and won his second title, it was at Dimension Data Pro-Am, followed in the same year by winning Telkom PGA Championship and the Platinum Classic, all of which increased his wealth to a large degree. He defended his title at Telkom PGA Championship in 2008, and in 2011 won the Africa Open in his home country, and managed to defend the title in 2012.</p><p>Louis had joined European tour in 2004, and won his first event in 2010 at the Open de Andalucia de Golf in Spain. The same year he won the Open Championship by a seven strokes margin, with the second lowest total posted in an Open at St Andrews of 272. Louis has also come very close to winning three more ‘majors’, losing in a play-off each time at the 2012 Masters, and in 2015 at both the US Open and the Open Championship. He reached his highest ranking, in fourth place in the Official World Golf list in early 2013.</p><p>After winning the Africa Open for two straight years, Louis continued successfully on the European tour, by winning four more titles – the Maybank Malaysian Open in 2012, Volvo Golf Champions in 2013 and 2014, while in 2016 he won ISPS Handa Perth International, further increasing his wealth. He has also been the highest ranked South African golfer for most of the last seven years, and internationally he has represented South Africa in the Eisenhower Cup in 2002, and at the World Cup in 2011, plus he was selected for the International Team in the Presidents Cup in both 2013 and 2015.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Louis has been married to Nel-Mare Oosthuizen since 2007, and the couple has three daughters.
