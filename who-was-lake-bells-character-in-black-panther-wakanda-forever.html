Recommended Videos Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has been in the wild for a week now, and we’ve had some time to experience and digest the follow-up to director Ryan Coogler’s Marvel film focused on the heroes in and around the nation of Wakanda.
Compared to other Marvel films and properties nowadays, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is fairly subdued when it comes to the amount of surprise appearances from outside the core cast of characters, instead rightfully focusing on the trials and tribulations of the denizens of Wakanda and Talokan."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Bell’s character gets close to making it out unscathed, until Namor launches her getaway helicopter out of the sky, appearing to seal her fate.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>As we know with Marvel films, no one can be truly presumed dead until you see the body. That said, for a presumably non-super normie, having your helicopter plucked out of the sky and yeeted into the ocean seems like a pretty done deal.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=false>Believe it or not, this wasn’t Bell’s first foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having previously played the voice of Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow in the animated series What If?.
