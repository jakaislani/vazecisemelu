His car was then repossessed after the City of Angels hit him with over&nbsp;$1,600 in unpaid parking tickets. After finding work in the classic profession of struggling actors — waiting tables — Hamm found work as a set dresser on adult films.</p><p>&nbsp;"A friend of mine from college — a girl — couldn't take working on the creepazoid downtown toxic set anymore," he said. "It seemed like a wonderful way to spend 12 hours a day five days a week for $150 a day...nonunion, no benefits, just a sh***y job with a lot of boobs and sad people. Hollywood, baby!"</p><p>Luckily, he met his former partner, Jennifer Westfeldt<strong>,</strong> at a party and she asked him to audition for an unpaid part in her play. "Suffice to say, when Jen called with an actual acting opportunity, my days as a set dresser—all told, about a month—were over," he revealed. Hamm then spent six months living on a friend's couch while performing in the play and continuing to look for work.&nbsp;Westfeldt's play eventually turned into the 2001 independent romantic comedy&nbsp;<a href=#>Kissing Jessica Stein</a>, that became, you guessed it, Hamm's second ever film role.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3FmZoZze9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjKOmp2WYlrquew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./little-debbie-vs-hostess-head-to-head-snack-off.html><span>←</span><span>Little Debbie vs Hostess: A Head-to-Head Snack Off</span></a>
