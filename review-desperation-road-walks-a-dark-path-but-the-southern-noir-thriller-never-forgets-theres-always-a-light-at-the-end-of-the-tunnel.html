Of course, forming a surrogate family with a fugitive mother/daughter duo wasn’t what he had in mind, although the unexpected family unit is soon expanded when they seek refuge with Russell’s father Mitchell, bringing all the grizzled gravitas you’d expect from Mel Gibson in a supporting role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A_0006C026_221012_154949_a1BZ3_20B_003-1.jpg><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>With law enforcement, local hoodlums, and an overarching fate that intertwines all of the key figures together, it’s easy to brand Desperation Road as a crime thriller, especially when the poster features Hedlund and Gibson brandishing firearms. That would be doing it a huge disservice, though, with complex and complicated dynamics between virtually every person with a speaking part creating a throughline that underpins every action – and subsequent reaction – as having a greater meaning.</p><p data-characters=632 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>That’s never truer than a huge reveal midway through that comes like a bolt out of the blue to those who haven’t read the book, one that Crocker smartly avoids foreshadowing and signposting until it becomes integral to the plot, which then recontextualizes everything that came before in the space of a single scene. It could have easily come off as a cynical rug-pull or storytelling sleight-of-hand dropped in for the sake of attempting to generate shocked reactions, but it both feels entirely organic to everything that’s come before while painting what’s to follow in the third act in a brand new light.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A_0002C019_221010_211855_a1BZ3_No-Scene_No-Take-1.jpg><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>Part Southern Gothic and part neo-Western with dashes of noir, bursts of violence, and a relentless undertone of grief, anguish, and regret, Desperation Road is always spinning at least a handful to its plates. To its credit, though, as often as one or two of them may begin to wobble, none of them come crashing down and shatter.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>The tonal balance isn’t an easy one to pull off, and filmmakers vastly more experienced than Crocker have tried and failed, so praise is due to the key creatives for taking something that sounds familiar and perhaps even formulaic on paper, but repainting it as an engaging, emotionally-driven genre film that both is and isn’t what you think it’ll turn out to be.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fair</h5><p class=review-summary>Nadine Crocker's slow-burning 'Desperation Road' may deal with the depths of darkness and despair, but excellent performances and a strong grasp of tone propel it towards the light.</p><p class=review-title></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqZ6umZrEbrDErKeeqpGptrC6jKummpxdrK6tt9JmmGackae4brzArZ9mmqWperW0xGaqqK2knbKzuoynpqKqXam1s7XLpZyrZZ6aw6a%2BjJ%2Bmq5%2BVqcBuwMeeqZ6rXZa5uK3YrGSaZZyetKnAjJqrZqyYmnqmusNmpp9lpJ2ybsDUp6WepF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hendrix-hart-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>Hendrix Hart | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
