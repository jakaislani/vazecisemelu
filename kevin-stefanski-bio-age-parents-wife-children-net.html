In 2020, Stefanski made a significant move by becoming the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, leading them to their first playoff appearance since 2002. His exceptional coaching skills earned him the title of NFL Coach of the Year after the season, making him the first Browns coach to receive this honor since 1976, and the first following the franchise’s return in 1999 as an expansion team.</p><p>Stefanski completed his education at St. Joseph’s Preparatory School in 2000 and the University of Pennsylvania in 2004. While at Penn, Stefanski showcased his talent as a defensive back and was honored with the title of Quakers Freshman of the Year in 2000. He was part of the only undefeated Penn team of the decade and received All-Ivy League recognition twice.</p><p>In 2006, Stefanski embarked on his coaching career, joining the Minnesota Vikings as an assistant under then-head coach Brad Childress. His dedication and skill led to a promotion in 2009, where he became the assistant quarterbacks’ coach, a position he held until the 2013 season. During this time, he had the opportunity to work with notable quarterbacks like Brett Favre and Christian Ponder. Stefanski’s tenure with the Vikings witnessed coaching changes, but he persevered through the transitions under coaches Childress, Leslie Frazier, and Mike Zimmer.</p><p>In 2017, following the termination of Scott Turner, Stefanski was elevated to the role of coaching the Vikings’ quarterbacks. His contributions were instrumental in transforming the Vikings into the NFL’s 10th-highest scoring offense. Quarterback Case Keenum had a remarkable season under Stefanski’s guidance, throwing 22 touchdown passes and only seven interceptions. Prior to his work with the quarterbacks, he had experience coaching running backs in 2016 and tight ends in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>In 2019, after the conclusion of the season, the New York Giants expressed interest in interviewing and hiring Stefanski as their new offensive coordinator, but the Vikings denied the request.</p><p>On January 13, 2020, <a href=# rel=noopener>Stefanski</a> signed a five-year contract to become the 18th head coach of the Cleveland Browns, just two days after the Minnesota Vikings were eliminated from the NFC playoffs. In his head coaching debut on September 13, 2020, Stefanski’s Browns fell to the Baltimore Ravens with a score of 38–6. This marked the 16th consecutive Week 1 without a win for the Browns. However, on September 17, Stefanski achieved his first career win as a head coach with a 35–30 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>On December 6, Stefanski led the Browns to their first winning season since 2007, securing their ninth win with a 41–35 victory over the Tennessee Titans. Under his guidance, the Browns achieved an 11–5 record, finishing third in the AFC North and clinching their first playoff berth since 2002. This was also the franchise’s best record since their return in 1999.</p><p>Unfortunately, Stefanski tested positive for COVID-19 just before the wild card game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, preventing him from coaching that game. Despite his absence, the Browns managed to defeat the Steelers 48–37, marking their first playoff win since 1994 and their first since their reactivation in 1999.</p><p>Stefanski returned to the team on January 14, but the Browns were eliminated in the AFC Divisional Round by the Kansas City Chiefs with a score of 22–17. For his outstanding performance during the 2020 season, Stefanski was honored as the Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year, becoming the first Browns coach to receive this accolade since Forrest Gregg in 1976, and the first since Cleveland’s return in 1999.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/sCFqnqbYoXQ/hqdefault.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kevin Stefanski Age</h2><p>As of October 2023, he was 41 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kevin Stefanski Parents</h2><p>His parents are Ed Stefanski and Karen Stefanski.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kevin Stefanski Wife</h2><p>He is married to Michelle Stefanski.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kevin Stefanski Children</h2><p>He has three children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kevin Stefanski Net Worth</h2><p>He has an estimated net worth of around $2 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqScr6GeYsC1scWapayjmWKvqruMmp6eZaCWv6a606xksKGWmnqktMilm6udnmK7psCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jose-perales.html><span>←</span><span>Jos Luis Perales Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
