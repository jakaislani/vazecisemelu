She was also bullied in school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Smith, Bakley grew up near a nudist colony, and the sisters accidentally attended a “clothes-off” swimming event when Bakley was 11. Bakley frequently returned to the colony after that, and people began taking photos of her and selling them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At 21, Bakley married her first cousin; they had two children together. Their daughter, Holly Gawron, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/bonny-lee-bakley-remarkable-story-played-big-role/story?id=60056830" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Barbara Walters" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Barbara Walters</a> in a 2015 interview that Bakley was her “best friend” and “supported me in anything I wanted to do.” However, Bakley’s behavior was often questionable and eventually turned criminal.<strong><br></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She developed a reputation as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/famous-grifters-stealers-swindlers-conartists data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a con artist" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a con artist</a>.
