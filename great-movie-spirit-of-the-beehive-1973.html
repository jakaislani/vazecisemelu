<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Spirit of the Beehive movie review (1973)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It’s an exciting day in the village. A ramshackle truck rattles into town announced by scampering children, who shout, “The movies! The movies!” A screen and projector are set up in the public hall, and an audience of kids and old women gather to see “Frankenstein” (1931).</p><p>For the children, the movie had might as well only be about the monster, so tellingly performed by <a href=#>Boris Karloff</a>. The creature comes upon a farmer’s young daughter tossing flowers into a pond to watch them float. Perhaps because of censorship, the film cuts directly from this to the monster mournfully carrying the child’s drowned body through the village. Perhaps because of censorship, we don’t see that he did not drown her, but threw her in with delight, thinking she would float as well. For the two girls, especially Ana (<a href=#>Ana Torrent</a>), this makes a dramatic impression.</p><p>Her misunderstanding of the scene will shape the events to follow in <a href=#>Victor Erice</a>’s “The Spirit of the Beehive” (1973), believed by many to be the greatest of all Spanish films. Although the time is not specified, it would have been clear to Spanish audiences that the film is set soon after the end of the Spanish Civil War, which began Franco’s long dictatorship — so soon after that the same day, a wounded opponent of the regime takes refuge in the barn-like outbuilding.</p><p>Only a few years separate Ana and Isabel (<a href=#>Isabel Telleria</a>), but they form that important divide where Ana depends on her big sister to explain mysteries. The little girl runs carefree all over the farmlands, and in the barn she discovers the wounded soldier. That night, her eyes wide open in the dark, she asks Isabel to explain why the creature drowned the little girl. “Everything in the movies is fake,” she’s told. “It’s all a trick. Besides, I’ve seen him alive. He’s a spirit.” That of course serves for Ana as a possible explanation for the wounded man, and the next day, she sneaks him some food and water, and her father’s coat.</p><p>What follows is considered a coded message about Franco’s fascist regime, but it’s not for me to connect the dots. I relate to it more strongly as a poetic work about the imagination of children, and how it can lead them into mischief and sometimes rescue them from its consequences.</p><p>“The Spirit of the Beehive” is one of only three features and a short subject directed by Erice (born 1940). Like such films as <a href=#>Charles Laughton</a>’s “<a href=#>The Night of the Hunter</a>” (1955), it is a masterpiece that can only cause us to wonder what we lost because he didn’t work more. It is simple, solemn, and in the casting of young Ana Torrent, takes advantage of her open, innocent features. We can well believe her when she accepts her sister’s explanation, which goes far to account for her behavior later in the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gqZ6ZpGK6sMLInmSsqJmntrV5zp9kraCVYq%2BmsceirZ5lYW6EdA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-mahomes-underwear.html><span>←</span><span>Shop Patrick Mahomes Lululemon Underwear 2023</span></a>
