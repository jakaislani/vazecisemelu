After her WWE release, as Tenille Dashwood, she competed in IMPACT Wrestling and on the independent circuit. Emma returned to WWE after a five-year absence on the October 28th episode of WWE SmackDown, answering Ronda Rousey’s open challenge.</p><p>Emma addressed her WWE return to <a href=#>Ryan Satin on Out of Character.</a> She stated that without even realizing it, she had this thought in her head that maybe she is done with IMPACT and that there are other choices she should explore and see what is available. Emma explained that it was probably due to her watching WWE and seeing all of the amazing developments with Triple H and what he was doing.</p><p>I guess it would have been within a few months of when Triple H returned. I was working with IMPACT and my contract was coming up. Maybe, without even realizing it, I had this idea in my mind that maybe I’m done with IMPACT and maybe there are other options that I should explore and see what’s possible. That was probably coming from me watching WWE and seeing all these awesome changes with Triple H and what he was doing, and I know I had that good rapport with him and all the stuff we did at NXT.</p><p>Probably, in the back of my mind, I started thinking like, ‘I wonder if I could actually go back to WWE.’ It was within a short time after that, probably a month or two, we ended up in touch. He said to me that he had been meaning to reach out even sooner, that I had been on his list, and he’s just been swamped, as you could imagine. That’s kind of where the conversation finally kicked off and then went from there. Next thing you know, I’m actually back. I joked about it so many times, all of a sudden it was like, ‘This is actually happening, I’m coming back to WWE after five years.’</p><p>Emma was romantically paired up on-screen with her real-life boyfriend Madcap Moss. Emma said that she still pinches herself from time to time because she loves what she does.</p><p>The former leader of the Emmalution even admitted that she joked about it with Madcap, but they never expected it to happen and didn’t discuss it with anybody else. Emma even confirmed that they didn’t pitch working together.</p><p>I’m still kind of pinching myself sometimes because I really enjoy what I do. Even Madcap and I, we joked about it so many times, ‘imagine if we worked together’ and all these storylines we joked about and things we would do, and then I actually end up back, on the same show as him, and then in a storyline together, which we had never discussed. We joked about, but we never really thought it would happen and we didn’t discuss it with other people.</p><p>That wasn’t us. It may seem like maybe it was, but he has his own ideas and I have mine. I just thought, ‘okay, they’re bringing me back,’ and I had this and that in my mind, and a week or two in, they said, ‘we’re going to put you guys together.’ ‘This is cool, we get to be together and an on-screen couple, what a cool thing.’ We’re definitely making the most of it.</p><p>Emma stated that she did not maintain contact with those in WWE throughout her five-year absence, instead isolating herself from the industry. Emma and Madcap have worked together at WWE live events to battle Karrion Kross and Scarlett, with whom they have interacted on WWE television.
