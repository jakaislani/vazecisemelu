According to the Federal Rules of Evidence, a <b>qualified expert witness</b> is <b>someone</b> who has knowledge, skill, education, experience, or training in a specialized field. These <b>qualifications</b> are generally also required of <b>expert witnesses</b> in state courts.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-are-the-qualifications-of-an-expert-witness-established></span>How are the qualifications of an expert witness established?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>witness</b> may be <b>qualified</b> as an <b>expert</b> based on knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. The standard is a minimal one. The <b>witness</b> need not be the best available <b>expert</b> or have extensive training. The <b>expert’s qualifications</b> must be <b>established</b> on the record before the <b>witness</b> is asked to give opinions.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-determines-if-a-witness-is-an-expert></span>Who determines if a witness is an expert?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the federal courts, judges <b>determine</b> the credibility of <b>expert witnesses</b> in a pre-trial Daubert hearing. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579 (1993). In considering <b>witnesses</b>‘ qualifications, judges may consider information that is not admissible as evidence.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-can-serve-as-an-expert-witness-in-court></span>Who can serve as an expert witness in court?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>An <b>Expert Witness can</b> be anyone with knowledge or experience of a particular field or discipline beyond that to be expected of a layman. The <b>Expert Witness’s</b> duty is to give to the <b>Court</b> or tribunal an impartial opinion on particular aspects of matters within his expertise which are in dispute.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-determines-if-a-forensic-scientist-is-an-expert-witness></span>Who determines if a forensic scientist is an expert witness?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To qualify as an <b>expert witness</b>, the <b>forensic scientist</b> must have a solid, documented background of education, training, and experience in the scientific discipline used to conduct the examinations, testing, or analyses about which the <b>forensic scientist</b> wants to testify.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-be-an-expert-witness-in-your-own-case></span>Can you be an expert witness in your own case?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A court may appoint an <b>expert</b>, and the plaintiff or defendant may select <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> as well. In order to testify, <b>expert witnesses</b> must first be approved by the judge overseeing the <b>case</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-discredit-an-expert-witness></span>How do you discredit an expert witness?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A key point to <b>discredit expert witnesses</b> is to attack their qualifications. If the cross-examiner can establish exaggerations in the <b>expert’s</b> qualifications not only will that <b>expert’s</b> credibility quickly fade, but the attorney who called that <b>witness</b> to the stand will likely lose credibility with the jury as well.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-giving-an-expert-testimony-easy></span>Is giving an expert testimony easy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Giving expert testimony</b> is a fairly <b>easy</b> part of the forensic scientist’s job. Proper collection, recording, and testing are essential to forensic work.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-when-an-expert-witness-is-wrong></span>What happens when an expert witness is wrong?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Consequences for Attorneys. Such matters would require an attorney’s knowledge that their <b>expert witness</b> has given <b>false</b> or fraudulent <b>testimony</b>. To win a case through such methods would be unethical. If such a situation does occur, it would certainly place the attorney and law firm in jeopardy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-expert-witnesses-bad></span>Why are expert witnesses bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“In the case of an <b>expert witness</b>, the fact that he or she is acting corruptly and makes the relevant false statement for reward, will make the case even more serious; but it will be a serious contempt of court even if the <b>expert witness</b> acts from an indirect financial motive (such as a desire to obtain more work from<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-lawyers-find-expert-witnesses></span>How do lawyers find expert witnesses?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Other methods <b>attorneys</b> use <b>to locate expert witnesses</b> include Directories, such as the SEAK <b>Expert Witness</b> Directory, Jurispro, ALM, <b>Expert</b> Pages, and HG <b>Experts</b>, literature searches, internet searches, and <b>expert witness</b> brokers and referral agencies such as TASA, Roundtable Group, and ForensisGroup.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-an-attorney-be-an-expert-witness></span>Can an attorney be an expert witness?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>lawyer</b> usually <b>can</b> become an <b>expert witness</b> in legal matters, to remove confusion about laws and regulations in the case and to prevent further confusion about something specific or minute regarding laws in a local or city issue.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-find-an-expert-witness-on-lexisnexis></span>How do I find an expert witness on Lexisnexis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>1) Simply use your pre-search filters under “Content Types” and select “<b>Expert Witness</b> Analysis.” 2) Then enter your <b>expert’s</b> name in the red search box and search! 3) Use your “Post Search Filters” to narrow by jurisdiction, keyword, date and more!<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6o7HCqKSeZZGjeqbEz56prWWnnsGvsdKsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./costco-food-court-double-chocolate-chunk-cookie-review.html><span>←</span><span>Costco Food Court Double Chocolate Chunk Cookie: An Honest Review</span></a>
