<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Whats Jaycee Dugards Daughter Starlet Dugard Doing?</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>Starlet’s mother was just 11 years old when she was abducted, and Phillip and Nancy Garrido held her captive for 18 years after she was taken from her family.</h3><p>In addition to this, she was held captive when she gave birth to her two children, Angel and Starlet. The question now is how they managed to get away from that location. Who are the Dugard sisters these days, and where are they?</p><h2>Where Does Starlet Dugard Stand Right This Moment?</h2><p>Starlet Dugard Was Born to Her Captive Mother at the Age of 17 Starlet Dugard was born on November 13, 1997, to her mother Jaycee Dugard through her captor Phillip. Jaycee Dugard was 17 years old at the time. Her mother was a teenager when she gave birth to her; she was only 17 years old at the time.</p><p>She was raised in the same environment where she was born, which was the backyard of their captor’s house in California. When Jaycee was just 11 years old, her alleged captors, Phillip Garrido, and his spouse Nancy Garrido, took her away from her home.</p><p>Her upbringing was extremely traumatic as a result of the conditions in which she was forced to spend her childhood.</p><p>Her mother did everything she could to provide a happy life for her children, despite the fact that their circumstances were extremely strange. Even though she only had education up to the level of the fifth grade, she reportedly began homeschooling her two girls.</p><p>Jaycee, the woman who gave birth to Starlet, was not taken to the hospital when she gave birth to her daughter. When the Garridos found out that she was experiencing discomfort during labor, they gave her a medication called codeine and forced her to view films of women giving birth so that she might figure out how to deliver a kid on her own in the future.</p><p>When their mother gave birth to Starlet Dugard and her sister Angel Dugard, both of them were still very young. She and her sister Angel used to view her mother’s abuser, Phillip, and Nancy as their parents and their mother as a sister. This was something that the children were taught to do by Garridos, who was also responsible for the abuse that their mother suffered at the hands of Phillip.</p><p>The Garridos had brought up the kids to believe that Jaycee was their sister, thus it was one of the more challenging components of the transition process for them to have to explain to the girls that Jaycee was their mother and not their sister.</p><p>In addition, despite everything that Starlet’s mother has been through, she did not stop thinking of Philip as her child’s father until a few years ago. Jaycee also admitted that she would prefer for her girls to not meet their biological father, but that she would respect their decision if they did so anyway. In addition to that, she remarked,</p><p>“I would hope that they wouldn’t want to, but as long as he’s behind bars and they’re safe, then I wouldn’t hinder their ability to make that choice,” the speaker said.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
