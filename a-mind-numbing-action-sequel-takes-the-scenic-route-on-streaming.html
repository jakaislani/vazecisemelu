Three years after the original, Under Siege 2: Dark Territory choo-chooed its way into theaters, to effectively tell pretty much the same story all over again, except this time the story unfolded on a train as opposed to a boat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image1-20.jpg><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Seagal’s Casey Ryback is still trying to live a quiet life as a chef, but things take a turn for the violent when he decides to head off on a scenic locomotive journey with his niece (played by a young Katherine Heigl). As tends to happen when the martial artist goes anywhere, a band of terrorists hijack the train and force him into action, causing him to once more dust off the lethal set of skills he thought he’d left behind forever.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Ironically, a 34 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes is still enough to see Under Siege 2 rank as one of Seagal’s better efforts, but it’s a pale imitation of its predecessor in every way. Not that streaming subscribers seem to mind, though, with Dark Territory snapping necks on the HBO Max charts.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=false>As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>, Geoff Murphy’s actioner can currently be found as the 11th most-watched title on the platform’s global rankings, even if you’re much better off watching the opener instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGalmaOxbrrUppmippdirqTAyKilZquVpsKmuIytmKSdo2LBqbGMrJqeppmYerO71K2cZqeeYsC1vsSapKKml2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-song-was-playing-in-the-truck-in-the-last-of-us-episode-4.html><span>←</span><span>What Song Was Playing in the Truck in The Last of Us Episode 4?</span></a>
