But her profile picture (<a href=# rel=nofollow>@maddysimmer</a>) has Wakefield on it, which is why fans are starting to believe these two are in a relationship.</p><p>Fans got even more impatient on wanting to know about Wakefield's relationship status after the <i>Australian Sun-Times </i>posted an article that said Wakefield was spotted going around jewellery stores looking for an engagement ring. However, Wakefield has refused to comment on the matter.</p><h2>Education Background</h2><p>The dream of making it big in the world of movies landed Wakefield on pursuing a degree in the relevant field.

His father served in the Navy, and his mother worked as a practitioner of Medical Standards.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Wakefield is not the only son of his parents.

You will be forgiven if you call him a model (If you had to guess his profession). He has an excellent build, further helped by his attractive face.</p><p>He is the same height as <a href=# rel=nofollow>Romany Malco</a> at<strong> 5 Feet 8 Inches</strong> (177 cm). He looks after himself as his weight is <strong>75 kg</strong>. He has gained weight but at the same time, he doesn't have any fat on his body.</p><p>Wakefield's body and face are complimented by his gorgeous blonde shoulder-length hair and his contagious smile. No wonder girls love him.</p><h2>Wakefield Is In Love With Painting&nbsp;</h2><p>You might be surprised because one of Wakefield's&nbsp;not-so-secret hobbies is painting. He loves to draw sketches. People who follow him on his socials are very much aware of his talent for painting. He has posted some pictures on his Instagram and has shown the world one of his talents.</p><p>One of his sketch posts has the houses and buildings around while the river flows between them. And one man is seen on a boat on the river passing through the buildings. He has captioned the post "Sketchy".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/28/83787492_1052291548478534_9042726784631791460_n%20(1)-1664362651896.jpg><p>The fans are nothing but praises for his talent for painting. One of his fans commented:</p><p>"You're an overall talented artist, mastering each art form",&nbsp;</p><p>While the other said:</p><p>"Wow, you're painting are beautiful".</p><h2>Active On Instagram</h2><p>There is good news for all Wakefield fans who want to learn about him and follow his life. Wakefield is on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn't frequently post on his Instagram. But he does post now and then. You will find him posting about his work, dogs, and other stuff on Instagram.</p><p>You can learn about Wakefield through his Instagram handle <a href=# rel=nofollow>@rhys_wakefield</a>.</p><h2>Had An Encounter With Crocodile&nbsp;</h2><p>Wakefield shared a story about the crocodile encounter, which shocked and amused his fans. He <a href=# rel=nofollow>posted a video</a> on his Instagram about an encounter with a crocodile on a boat. He said he almost capsized the boat because the crocodile tried to jump abroad.</p><p>The story might sound scary (and it probably is), but he seemed to have a good laugh about it. Even the fans seemed to enjoy the story.</p><p>One of them commented, "Sorry, but this made me lol SO HARD", while the other commented, "I'd say it's an honest reaction to a crocodile lol".</p><h2>Wakefield's Accolades</h2><p>The actor Wakefield&nbsp;made an impression with his role in the 2013 movie <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>The</i> <i>Purge</i></a>. It was not only the audience that recognized his skill but also the film association. His performance in the movie landed him the ''<strong>Fright Meter Award</strong>'' in 2013 for the "Best Supporting Actor" category.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Besides <i>The Purge</i>, he has received a nod from multiple film associations for his performance in <i>The Black Balloon </i>and <i>Home and Away.</i></p><p>He landed nominated for Logie Awards, IF Awards, Australian Film Institute, Brazil Cinefest, and Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards. Though he didn't win it, getting recognition from all these institutes is still a huge deal.</p><h2>Australian Actor Wakefield Is A Shy Man&nbsp;</h2><p>People don't quickly expect actors to be an introvert or shy. After all, an actor's job is to use his body to act and convince the audience through his role, whether on-screen for movies or off-screen for theatres.</p><p>So, it might sound surprising to some that Wakefield is a shy guy in real life. Despite his impressive body, he doesn't feel comfortable showing it on camera.</p><p>While doing the 2008 film <i>The Black Balloon</i>, he had to do some explicit scenes. He revealed it was the most uncomfortable thing to do, and it got him kind of scared when he was told about the scene.</p><p>Upon questioning about the scene, he said:</p><p>I'm the kind of guy that gets nervous being half-naked in my room, so considering there was a whole crew as well as randoms in their cars watching... yeah, I was pretty freaked out about it.</p><p><i><strong>&nbsp; Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more celebrity biographies</strong></i><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqufsqtdrK6sscWinKWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-jake-sully-die-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html><span>←</span><span>Does Jake Sully die in Avatar: The Way of Water?</span></a>
