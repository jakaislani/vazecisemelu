But, when Kevin accidentally summons a posse of witches known as The Three Mothers, he and Amber need to work together to survive the subsequent attack and somehow send the witches back to where they came from.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jack-champion-avengers-endgame.png><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Following his debut in The Night Sitter, Champion made the one-in-a-million shot of jumping straight to Avengers: Endgame, one of the most culturally impactful blockbusters of our time.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>The young Champion loaned his talents for the iconic, illustrious role of Kid on Bike, a small boy on a bicycle who offers Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang a thousand-yard stare when he enquires what happened, having missed Infinity War‘s Thanos-related shenanigans due to being trapped in the Quantum Realm.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/avatar-the-way-of-water-2.jpg><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Champion then went from blockbuster to blockbuster with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Way of Water</a>, in which he portrayed Spider, the son of antagonist Miles Quaritch and close friend of Jake and Neytiri’s children, later being adopted into the family at the end of the film.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Champion will reprise his role in Avatar 3 and Avatar 4, which he filmed alongside Way of Water to ensure he didn’t age out of the role.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Scream VI (2023)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Group-shot-Scream-VI.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>Champion’s latest appearance was in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scream VI</a>, where he filled the shoes of franchise newcomer Ethan Landry, the roommate of Scream V‘s Chad Meeks-Martin and arguably the number one Ghostface suspect. Champion once compared the filming of Scream VI to a “really fun summer vacation,” alluding to the intensity that came with his previous work on the Avatar franchise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What are Jack Champion’s upcoming movies?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Avatar 3 (2024) and Avatar 4 (2026)</h3><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>As mentioned earlier, Champion will be bringing Spider back for Avatar 3 and Avatar 4, having filmed his scenes during Way of Water‘s production to avoid the Stranger Things effect, so to speak.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>It’s safe to assume that Spider will remain a steadfast ally of Jake and company, having been adopted into their family following the events of Way of Water. As for what he and the Na’vi could be up against in the third and fourth films, all we know for sure is that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar 3 will introduce the “ash people,”</a> Na’vi with a fire affinity and who apparently aren’t as peaceful as the Omatikaya or Metkayina clans.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>Avatar 3 is in post-production at the time of writing and is due in theaters on December 20, 2024. Avatar 4, meanwhile, is still filming, and is set to release on December 18, 2026.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Retribution (TBA)</h3><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Outside of Avatar, Champion also has Retribution, an action thriller film based on the 2015 Spanish film El desconocido (“The Stranger” in English), on the docket. He will portray the unnamed son of protagonist Matt Turner, played by Liam Neeson; if he keeps this up, Champion just might set a record for the coolest collection of movie dads.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>At the time of writing, Retribution is in post-production and has no set release date.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Freaky Tales (TBA)</h3><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>The young actor will also appear in Freaky Tales, an upcoming drama film from Captain Marvel filmmaking duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. Champion will star alongside the likes of Pedro Pascal, Ben Mendelsohn, and Dominique Thorne in the film, which follows four interconnected stories that occur during real-life events in 1987 Oakland.</p><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=47 data-injectable=false>Filming for Freaky Tales wrapped in early 2023.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Everything’s Going to be Great (TBA)</h3><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Champion’s final upcoming project at the time of writing is Everything’s Going to be Great, where he’ll star alongside Bryan Cranston, Allison Janney, and fellow young actor Benjamin Evan Ainsworth (The Haunting of Bly Manor) as a member of a struggling, borderline nomadic family who survive by performing in regional theater productions, all whilst coping with loss and a lack of identity.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>Everything’s Going to be Great is currently filming in Toronto.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonK%2Bdoq56q63CpGScoJGivaq7zWakqK6ZmnqiusNmmKWkXZ22tHnUqZqopZmjtG65zq%2BgnmWgp7yrscKtqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carla-harris-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Carla Harris Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
