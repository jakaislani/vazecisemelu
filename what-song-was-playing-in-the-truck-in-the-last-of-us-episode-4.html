Recommended Videos HBO’s The Last of Us returned with yet another nail-biting hour of television, and more haunting music to sink its teeth into its unsuspecting audience.&nbsp;
Much like The Last of Us game that served as its inspiration, music has played a pivotal role in underscoring the onscreen narrative and in some cases, may have even done something close to pulling off the ‘Kate Bush effect’ we saw in Stranger Things 4 last summer."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

When Joel, who during the events of The Last of Us is 56 years of age, says the song is “before his time”, he certainly means it, with “Alone and Forsaken” originally recorded live on the radio in the late 1940’s, and officially released by MGM in 1955, at which point Williams had already passed away.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>As with The Last of Us episode three ‘Long Long Time’, this week’s episode ‘Please Hold My Hand’ is titled after one of the most prominent lyrics in Willams’ song. It certainly made for quite the road trip song across a desolate America that had long been lost to the forces of both war and nature.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKynnpx6uK3SZqelmameu6h5yKdkraCVYsGzwcKkZKKmXam1pnnLmqqtZZ%2Bbera%2FjJ6noqufmbJugI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vegan-sushi.html><span>←</span><span>Vegan Sushi</span></a>
