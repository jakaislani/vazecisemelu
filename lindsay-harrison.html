<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>End of Days' co-author, Lindsay Harrison is a New York Based writer and blogger.</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Lindsay Harrison</strong> works as a creative director at <i>Ziff Media Group,</i> located in New York. She has expertise in digital content media and is a professional writer, editor, and blogger. Harrison is also a minor contributor to a book called <i>"End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies about the End of the World."</i></p><p>Harrison's first book, a memoir titled, <i>"Missing"</i> is about a tragic event that left her devastated. Her mother committed suicide in 2006, and the book showcases some of her family's memory. There are many things to know about Lindsay and her professional career. So, stay with us!</p><h2>Author Lindsay Harrison: Know her Background</h2><p>The former AOL's Senior Content Strategist, Miss Harrison, was born on <i>December 31, 1985,</i> in the United States. She was born to mother <strong>Michele,</strong> who died by suicide in 2006. Her father is an engineer who graduated from Princeton University. Also, she has two older brothers named <strong>Chris</strong> and <strong>Brad</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/23/Sylvbro-1584960078408.jpg><p>One of the rising female writers, Lindsay received her undergraduate degree from Brown University. Besides, she has a Masters's in writing from Columbia University.</p><p>Lindsay's dad served as a president and CEO of a high-tech company which he sold at the age of fifty. Her parents divorced after being married for almost two decades. After the divorce, her father married another woman with a same name of her biological mom, Michele.</p><h2>Lindsay Harrison Marital Status</h2><p>The 34-year-old author prefers to have a low key profile. She is very busy on her professional career. Hence, there is a lack of romance in Harrison's life. The information about her marital status is not known. She might be married, or she may have a husband. Who knows? She is not active on social media as well, which makes it difficult to know if she has a boyfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/23/Has-1584960200822.jpg><p>Now coming to Lindsay's romantic affairs, she hasn't spoken a single word. She has gone through a <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>difficult</strong></a> time during her parents' marriage. Therefore, without substantial evidence to talk about her romantic status would be unethical.</p><h2>Lindsay and Sylvia: End of the World and Prophecy's Truth</h2><p>Recently, the world has been facing a global pandemic in the face of a disease called <i>"Corona Virus (COVID-19)."</i> Some of the Hollywood stars, such as <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a> and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Rita Wilson</strong></a><strong>,</strong> also tested positive for the corona-virus. But why Lindsay Harrison and self-proclaimed psychic author, <a href=#><strong>Sylvia Browne</strong></a>'s book made a buzz?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/23/Prophecy-1584959635828.jpg><p>Well, in the 2008 book <i>"End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies about the End of the World"</i> Browne wrote:</p><p>"In around 2020, a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments."</p><p>However, Browne's prediction is not entirely accurate. According to a paranormal investigator, COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia, but it's not a "severe pneumonia-like illness." Browne, who died in 2013, had many predictions proven false.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The exact amount of Harrison's net worth is a topic of mystery, but certain estimations can be done. She has worked for several companies as a writer and content strategist. As per Glassdoor, the average salary for a content strategist is around <strong>$70,000</strong> per year.</p><p>Harrison currently works as a creative director for a media company; therefore, her annual income must be over <strong>$105,000</strong>. In conclusion, Lindsay Harrison might have a net worth of over <strong>$300,000</strong>.</p><p><i><strong>For more updates, follow </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>marriedceleb.com</strong></i></a><i><strong>!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqWgp5yjlsZutMCrqaKrn6M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./crime-punishment-2018.html><span>←</span><span>Crime + Punishment movie review (2018)</span></a>
