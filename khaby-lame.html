He is primarily recognized for his success on TikTok, where he has over 140 million followers. Khaby was the second-most followed person on TikTok for numerous years, after only Charli D’Amelio.</strong></p><p>Khaby’s 142.5 million followers eclipsed Charli’s 142.2 million in June 2022, making him the most-followed person on TikTok. Lame disclosed in an exclusive interview with Fortune that he can earn up to $750,000 for every video clip, making him a salary of nearly $10 million in 2022.</p><p>He also has over 80 million Instagram followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Khaby Lame?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Khabane Lame</a> was born in Senegal on March 9, 2000. The family relocated to Italy when he was a baby. They subsequently relocated to Chivasso, where they lived in a public housing complex.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many houses and cars does Khaby Lame have?</h2><p>In fewer than three years, he has amassed a fortune that few others have. He purchased a BMW, Mercedes Benz G Waggon, Jeep Compass Sport, and other luxury vehicles with the millions he earned from his Instagram reels and Tik Tok videos. So, without further ado, let’s have a look at Khaby Lame’s automotive collection, an Italian Senegalese TikToker.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does Khaby Lame make annually?</h2><p>This year, the influencer is expected to earn around $10 million. His rapid ascent has occurred in less than two years, with his debut video being posted in 2020.</p><p>Khaby reportedly earns more than $400,000 every brand sponsored film, and he is known to have invested in real estate, restaurants, and software companies.</p><p>According to Fortune, Khaby has committed a significant amount of time to learning English every day by viewing American films and cartoons and spending an hour with a tutor. The TikTok star has made no secret of his desire to become an actor. He was granted Italian citizenship last month after living in Italy since he was a year old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many businesses does Khaby Lame own?</h2><p>Khaby Lame lived in a small two-room house without basic facilities prior to his social media stardom. Khaby Lame began his career in this residence and stayed for the first six months after joining TikTok. However, Khaby Lame quickly rose to prominence and began making large sums of money from his amusing films.</p><p>Lame recently purchased a multi-million dollar luxury mansion for a stunning $6 million. Khaby Lame’s new residence has a swimming pool, a home theatre, improved security, a tennis court, and a wine cellar. Khaby Lame has shown the world that it is possible to rise beyond poverty and live a lavish life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What brands does Khaby Lame have?</h2><p>To begin, in 2021, he teamed with his first Indian brand, “Dream11,” a fantasy sports platform.

The varsity jacket and hoodie are part of the ‘Boss x Khaby’ line.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Investments does Khaby Lame have?</h2><p>Khaby was a lowly factory worker in Chivasso before becoming one of the world’s most famous social media stars. He was laid off in March 2020 after COVID-19 shut down much of the country’s manufacturing.</p><p>In his spare time, he began posting on TikTok on a regular basis. He swiftly came up with an amazingly simple magic formula: he released videos mocking overly sophisticated life hack videos, complete with his now-trademark annoyed sardonic sneer.</p><p>His homemade short reaction films propelled him to the top of TikTok’s popularity. As previously stated, he is the most followed individual on the network as of this writing, with over 158.3 million followers, barely ahead of Charli D’Amelio.</p><p>Khaby has gained millions from sponsorships, appearance fees, and merchandising as a result of his fast rise to prominence. He thinks that he earns roughly $400,000 for each TikTok clip he develops for a certain company.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Endorsement deals has Khaby Lame?</h2><p>Khaby Lame has teamed and collaborated with a variety of worldwide companies, including Xbox, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Dream 11, and Juventus.</p><p>Khaby Lame signed a multi-year contract with Hugo Boss in 2022. This agreement would see him join heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua, World Cup champion Raphael Varane, model Hailey Bieber, and others in their #BeYourOwnBOSS campaign.</p><p>Surprisingly, both TikTok and Instagram have put videos about Khaby Lame on their official pages, tagging him and establishing custom hashtags for him. As a result, a collaboration between Lame and the two social networking platforms is likely.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many charities has Khaby Lame donated to?</h2><p>The African-Italian TikToker is fond of giving back to the community and less privileged.
