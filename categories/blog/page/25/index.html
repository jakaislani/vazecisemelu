It's not the first time the Coens have made a movie about blind greed but "No Country for Old Men" certainly is their strongest take on this theme yet. Thus it feels very odd to me how this whole sense of impervious capitalism has been neglected in the discussion around the movie. "No Country for Old Men" is all about money and money taking the place of moral principles.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Deichmann SE Mike Deichmann Obituary And Death Cause</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>
