This Instant Pot pinto beans recipe has become my favorite way to cook pinto beans.

Then, suddenly, two of the biggest black movies were about women. "Coffy" starred Pam Grier as a nurse who goes on the warpath against drug dealers, and was one of the year's top money-makers.

<a href=../../../../is-it-ok-for-water-to-go-in-babys-ears.html></a>
It's OK to get water in your baby's ears. Don't try to dry the inside of your baby's ears with cotton swabs (Q-tips); you can damage the eardrum. To get the water out, just gently turn her head to the side and let the water run out, then dry the outside of the ear with a soft towel. What happens if water gets in baby ears? Water in the ear canal can lead to swimmer's ear, an infection in the ear canal.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/15/>← Prev Page</a>
