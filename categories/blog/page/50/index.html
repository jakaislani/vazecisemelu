Many states and localities have been adopting “ban-the-box,” prohibiting employers (including private employers) from asking applicants to disclose information concerning their criminal histories prior to an initial interview or a conditional offer of employment. Currently, all New England states except Maine and New Hampshire have a ban-the-box law that is applicable to private employers. Bills that would have applied ban-the-box to private employers in both Maine and New Hampshire died in last year’s legislative sessions, but there is a good chance that similar legislation will resurface.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rich Brian Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography</h2><time>Jun 12, 2024</time>

Ahh, Valentines Day… such a loved and hated holiday, right? It’s one of my personal favorites because it’s the one night a year Jack cooks and I don’t lift a finger. (Or, at least, I try – admittedly, it’s hard to sit back and keep my “suggestions” to myself).
