<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>I, Daniel Blake movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Stand-up comedian <a href=#>Dave Johns</a>, starring in his first feature film as the title character, has an everyman directness that makes him instantly relatable before we even see him. We hear him first, over the opening titles, answering ridiculous, circular questions from a government health-care agent that don’t get to what’s really ailing him: his heart. With his thick, musical accent, Daniel can’t help but respond with humor and incredulity in the face of such cluelessness. Who hasn’t felt the same frustration, whether it’s with the bank, a utility company or our own health insurance provider?</p><p>But this truly is just the beginning for Daniel, who runs into an even more maddening battle when he physically goes to the benefits office with the hope that an actual human being might help him. Here’s where the veteran&nbsp;director&nbsp;and his collaborator of many years, screenwriter <a href=#>Paul Laverty</a>, undermine their very worthwhile point, though. Except for one unusually kindhearted&nbsp;woman, they depict all the employees there as monsters, from security guards to case analysts to managers. It’s a pretty black-and-white situation without a whole lot of room for shading.</p><p>While he’s there, however, Daniel meets a young&nbsp;woman&nbsp;who’s in an even direr financial situation than he is: Katie (<a href=#>Hayley Squires</a>), a single mother who recently moved to town with her daughter and son because they couldn’t afford to live in London anymore. Katie dreams of returning to college and getting a degree, but in the meantime she goes door-to-door seeking house cleaning work and forgoing dinner so her kids can eat. For the most part, Loach depicts her plight in matter-of-fact fashion but with obvious appreciation for this character’s sacrifices. Her welfare claim rejected, Katie goes with great shame to a food bank to feed her kids in the film’s most quietly powerful scene. Subsequent acts of desperation, however, become increasingly melodramatic and maudlin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46iZJ2Znp6yrXnBpZiknV1nfXKC</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-ash-ever-meet-his-dad.html><span>←</span><span>Does Ash ever meet his dad?</span></a>
