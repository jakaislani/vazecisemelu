"I was asked by Jon's family to post this next slide ..." she wrote on Instagram Stories (via <a href=#>Page Six</a>). "It is with profound remorse and sorrow that we must report that our beloved Andrew Jonathan Hill passed away on Aug. 10, 2022."</p><p dir=ltr>One day after her announcement, Jaclyn was back on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, this time penning the sweetest tribute to her late ex-husband. "I can't believe this day has actually come," the cosmetic mogul began. "I am so out of my mind right now, I don't know how I'm even going to type this. But I'm going to try." Jaclyn then went on to describe Jon as the "most kind and compassionate person," adding that while she is indeed heartbroken about his death, she is comforted that he is now truly free.</p><p>Though a cause of death is yet to be announced, Jon had previously struggled with substance abuse and addiction — something he once confirmed to <a href=#>Billboard</a> to have "kicked off" when he was only 17. Jon and Jaclyn got married in 2009 and remained together for nine years before <a href=#>splitting in 2018</a>. Despite the end of their marriage, however, Jon and Jaclyn remained cordial through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm5jbX1xe9iorK2tkpq%2FbrbAnKOypl2dtq24jKucr52RocBuwNGanqKbXaG8tL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-elizabeth-ii-mechanic-world-war-ii.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Elizabeth's Surprising Military Role in World War II</span></a>
