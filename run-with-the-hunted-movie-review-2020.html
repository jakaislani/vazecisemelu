<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Run with the Hunted movie review (2020)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Remember how The Catcher In The Rye opens with Holden Caulfield telling the therapist (or caseworker, who ever it is) that he doesn’t wanna bore him with any “<a href=#>David Copperfield</a> crap?” With Peaches, “Run with the Hunted” gets into Great Expectations crap, with Oscar joining a group of street urchins overseen by grizzly man <a href=#>Mark Boone</a>, Jr., who is himself overseen by moderately smoother crime underboss <a href=#>Ron Perlman</a>. Hell, maybe it’s really just the “<a href=#>Bugsy Malone</a>” variant of “<a href=#>Where The Day Takes You</a>.”</p><p>At the halfway point, cute-as-a-button Oscar becomes <a href=#>Michael Pitt</a> Oscar. Playing a grownup criminal street urchin isn't a stretch for Pitt, and so he does that routine, with adult Peaches, now played by <a href=#>Dree Hemingway</a>, with shaved head and a semi-goth strip-club get-up for working hours. It’s a hardscrabble life for sure, and Perlman’s character is still overseeing it. But a reckoning seems to be in the offing. Director Swab handles this all with due dispatch and an ability that’s a hair or two above what you’d call mere competence. One has to give him that. But not a whole lot more.</p><p>In any event, a complication arrives in the form of grown-up Loux (Sam Quartin), who takes a job with an amusingly irascible private eye (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) and picks up the trail, there, of her lost childhood friend. Their paths physically cross almost immediately, which is a hair improbable, but also fortunate because it helps this irritating film, with its cheap earnestness and its look-at-me-I’m-an-autodidact literary pretension (the title is a Bukowski lift, oh wow), reach its finale that much faster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46rrKdlp57BqXnToZxmoKWjwaawjKamr6GVYr%2BmwsiermZqYGd9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-basseys-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Basseys Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
