Born on 5 February 1947, Darrell is a three time NASCAR Cup Series champion. A well-known sports car racer who has set various records in the sport, Darrell was active as a NASCAR driver from 1972 until his retirement in 2005.</p><p>One of the most popular car racers of all times, one may wonder how rich is Darrell? As of early 2016, Waltrip counts his net worth at the amount of $25 million. Needless to say, he has amassed this wealth by being involved in car racing as a driver for more than three decades, and since then putting his knowledge to good use as an analyst and commentator.</p><h3>Darrell Waltrip Net Worth $25 Million</h3><p>Raised in Owensboro, Darrell grew interested in car racing at the very young age of twelve, and started his career racing in Go-karts. His first stock car experience came only four years later. Although he started out with dirt-track racing, he eventually found his passion for asphalt and started his NASCAR career when he was 25 years old. He went on to become very successful in that career and won several major races; he won the NASCAR Cup Series championship thrice in 1981, 1982 and 1985 and was also the series runner-up in 1979, 1983 and 1986. This became the pivotal part of his life, and when his net worth started rising exponentially.</p><p>Darrell is noted as the second to Jeff Gordon for winning most races in NASCAR’s modern era while he is still the fourth on NASCAR’s all-time winners list, with 84 wins during a career spanning almost 30 years. His achievements include 1989 Daytona win, five Coca-Cola 600 wins, 1985 Winston 500 win, 1981 Busch Clash win and 1976 Snowball Derby win among numerous other wins. In addition to this, he has also won 13 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series races as well as seven American Speed Association races. Given these wins, Waltrip became the first person to get rewarded with over $10 million prize money, actually very close to $20 million, which has obviously added significantly to his net worth.</p><p>For his contributions towards the sport, Darrell has earned several awards including two NASCAR’s Most Popular Driver Award, three National Motorsports Press Association Driver of the Year. Moreover, he was also rewarded with NASCAR’s Driver of the Decade award for the 80s, and was inducted into Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2003. In 2012, he was inducted to the NASCAR Hall of Fame which sums up how successful Darrell was in his profession before his retirement from the sport in 2005.</p><p>Talking about his personal life, Darrel has been married to Stevie since 1969. These days, he serves as a color analyst for Fox Sports in his ‘retirement’ life. His hobbies include collecting his racing cars that he drove in several of his races. As of now, the legendary sportsman enjoys his life as a retired successful car racer while his present net worth of $25 million caters to his daily life.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.75079533404><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Darrell Waltrip</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$25 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 5, 1947</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Owensboro, Kentucky, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Race car driver, Actor, Voice Actor, Announcer, Commentator</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Stevie R.
