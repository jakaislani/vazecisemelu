Upon seeing the pair, Constantine declares, “Oh, bollocks! It’s my ex!”, to which Raven deadpans “You and Harley? Gross.” Somewhat affronted, Constantine replies, “Do I look mad?” The shot then quickly pans up to King Shark, who gives a knowing wink as Constantine acts nervous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ImmZWVZ-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kq4kmMn-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TqKnu5r-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SdLIl9a-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/zkv36TF-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PMf7w7y-1.jpg><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>While speaking to CBR, Matt Ryan revealed his reaction to the exchange and what he feels it means for how Constantine’s sexuality can be defined, saying:</p><p>“In Legends, then, he’s obviously bisexual and, with King Shark, he’s obviously ‘bi-specieal.’ So, Constantine is the most open, liberated person on the planet. I don’t know the logistics of how that works but I just guffawed when I was reading it. I was like, ‘Oh, that’s brilliant!’”</p><p data-characters=635 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=false>Bi-erasure is still a problem in much of popular media, with bisexuality often being perceived as being either gay people afraid to fully commit or straight people just ‘experimenting’ or ‘going through a phase.’ Constantine being portrayed as open in his preferences in a manner intended to neither titillate nor make a statement, but simply being a part of who he is, is more significant than is often given credit for. As such, the expansion on his romantic predilections in <strong>Justice League Dark: Apokolips War</strong> adds a significant, albeit humorous, facet to one of the most popular additions to DC adaptations in recent years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJqspGK%2Fuq3NZqmemZOpwG6vzqeqrZmeqbavsYyrnK%2BdkaF6q8HSraCcnV2hsqKz1J5knZmioHqivM6kpqWhoKh6uK3RaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marion-marshall-biography-obituary-jewellery-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Marion Marshall Biography; Obituary, Jewellery, Measurements</span></a>
