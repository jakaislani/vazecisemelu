<a href=../../transformers-rise-beasts-post-credits-scene.html></a>
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a bit of an oddity as a Transformers movie. It‚Äôs mostly a reboot for the franchise, though it directly follows 2018‚Äôs Bumblebee, and briefly alludes to that movie in passing. It continues the long run of portraying Optimus Prime more as a bloodthirsty (oil-thirsty? Energon-thirsty?) villain than as the noble hero he tends to be outside live-action installments.
It brings in Beast Wars‚Äô Maximals characters, but doesn‚Äôt find much use for them, except to look cool in battle and partly counter Prime‚Äôs more autocratic (heh, autocratic) tendencies.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Beth Hall Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Apr 28, 2024</time>
