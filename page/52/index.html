HP's Cruelest Cut: DreamColor in 1080p
I'm not usually one to complain about the difference between 1080p and 1200p in a notebook screen, but the shift to a 16:9 aspect from the HP EliteBook 8740w to the 8760w just rubs me the wrong way. It's true that 1920x1200 screens are going the way of the dodo (which is why I'll run my three into the ground), but I don't know who else is even using HP's DreamColor IPS panel to begin with.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Princess Mononoke movie review (1999)</h2><time>Jun 7, 2024</time>

It tells an epic story set in medieval Japan, at the dawn of the Iron Age, when some men still lived in harmony with nature and others were trying to tame and defeat it. It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tim McGraw, FGL, Dan + Shay and More Take Over Austin for 2019 iHeartCountry Festival Celeb Secr</h2><time>Jun 7, 2024</time>
