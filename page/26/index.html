<a href=../../8-ways-olivia-colman-and-emilia-clarke-can-return-to-the-mcu-after-secret-invasion.html></a>
Secret Invasion has a lot to answer for, but something we can be grateful about is that the otherwise underwhelming Disney Plus series gave us two exciting new additions to the MCU. Fans were overjoyed when both Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke were added to the Marvel universe, hoping for big things from both of them. While theories might’ve been way off — Clarke didn’t turn out to be Abigail Brand, for instance — thankfully the Secret Invasion finale leaves the door open for more from both of them.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Colton Woodward movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>

<a href=../../its-a-disaster-2013.html></a>
“It’s a Disaster" is a comedy. The casting of David Cross (“Arrested Development,” “Mr. Show”) and several Second City Chicago alumni, should tip you off to that. But I’m not sure I’d describe the movie as a “black comedy,” although the specter of imminent annihilation is, I grant you, a little on the “dark” side. This is more like a comedy of manners — really bad manners. The humor is indirect and relatively low-key, like the random sirens outside that nobody pays any attention to.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Owen Joyner Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>
