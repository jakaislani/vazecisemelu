The men meet up in Uganda, where a big push is on to complete a railroad faster than the Germans or the French. The owner of the rail company is a gruff tycoon who boasts, “I'm a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting those people who work for me.” He is too modest. He also torments those who watch this movie.
Work on the railroad bridge is interrupted by a lion attack.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Antoni Porowski's Shirtless Shots</h2><time>Jul 23, 2024</time>

And while we’re on that note, NVIDIA let us know that with their focus on cooling on the GTX 580 they aren’t going to be letting custom GTX 580 designs go out without a more thorough inspection.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brawl In Cell Block 99 Review [Fantastic Fest 2017]</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>

Instead of crashing weddings, Vaughn is pulverizing skulls. Instead of running his mouth about how “money” people are, he’s quiet, frosty and speaking through dangerous actions. Even with Hacksaw Ridge and True Detective under his belt, this is a new, beastly look for the longtime funnyman, and what a break in character it is.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Cookies</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>
