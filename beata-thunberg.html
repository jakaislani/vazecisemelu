She will celebrate her 15th birthday in the coming <i>November 5, 2020. </i>Her sister Greta has gained worldwide notoriety for her cold, cynical, and inspiring climate change speeches. We will be talking about her achievements as well.

Her mother, Malena, earned international fame after she represented her home country Sweden at the <i>2009 Eurovision Song Contest</i> in Moscow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/6/Beata-1599372638664.jpg><p>On the other hand, Beata's father, Svante, an actor/producer, manages the career of Malena. Beata was chosen as the face for the marketing campaign for a series of books written by author <strong>Elias Våhlund</strong>, titled <i>Handbook for Superheroes</i>. Beata went on an international marketing tour for the book. The book series is available in 17 different languages.</p><p>Further, Beata has appeared on the Swedish television shows in Malou, discussing her ADHD, OCD history, and dealing with bullying as a teenager. She then performed an original song called <i>"Bara Du Vill,"</i> while wearing a dress that was emblazoned with one of the book's superheroes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/6/Beata1-1599373576460.jpg><p>Thunberg continues to appear on TV, performing her single at various concerts and promoting the book with Våhlund. Beata will appear alongside her mother in a Stockholm musical in <i>January 2021</i>.</p><h2>Beata Thunberg Books</h2><p>Beata co-authored two books with Svante, Malena, and Greta. The first was Malena’s autobiography, <i>Scenes from the Heart</i>, which takes place as Malena and her family tour Europe to promote Ernman’s singing career. It covers a tumultuous time where Greta and Beata both start falling victim to their mental health disorders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/6/Malenafam-1599373689787.jpg><p>The second book is <i>Our House Is On Fire: Scenes of a Family and a World in Turmoil,</i> to be published in 2020.

Like Thunberg, <a href=#><strong>Brendon Urie</strong></a> was also diagnosed with ADHD at a young age.</p><p><i><strong>Watch Beata singing on national television!</strong></i></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Further, Malena writes that Beata is prone to unpredictable outbursts of anger where she screams obscenities at her mother. In one instance, she called her mom <i>“a horrible devil”</i> and threw DVD cases at her.</p><p>Beata’s OCD causes her to insist on walking with her left foot in front, refuse to step on certain parts of the sidewalk, and demand that her mother walk the same way. She used to insist that her mother wait outside while she was in class at school, demanding she not to move at all.&nbsp;<br>In Scenes From the Heart, Malena concludes that Beata and Greta’s disorders are “not a handicap” but a “superpower.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpucmqyRYsGpwc2bnKuf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacky-clark.html><span>←</span><span>Jacky Clark</span></a>
