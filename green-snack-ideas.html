They’re good for martinis, a tapenade, or just eating straight out of the jar with your grubby little fingers. In our <a href=#>best green olives</a> ranking, writer <a href=#>Danny Palumbo</a> opened our eyes to the wonderful world of stuffed olives when he placed Mezzetta’s garlic-stuffed olives in the top spot. He called them “decadent and fatty and a damn good snack.” A damn good snack, indeed—and a green snack, as luck would have it.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Dietz & Watson Kosher Pickle Spears</strong></a><p>Dill pickles are one of the best green snacks money can buy. And the best dill pickles money can buy are Dietz & Watson’s Kosher Pickle Spears, according to senior writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick’s</a> ranking of the <a href=#>best dill pickles</a>. Jordan described these pickles as “crunchy, flavorful, and juicy.” What more could we ask for from a pickle? And in my opinion, the spear is an elite pickle shape—it’s easy to bite into and you can get right to the pickle meat while only having to battle a fraction of the skin.&nbsp;(Please feel free to use the phrase “pickle meat” more often.)</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Brad’s Crunchy Kale Chips</strong></a><p>We weren’t so sure about kale chips at the beginning of our taste test, but after trying a few flavors, we started to understand their leafy appeal. In their ranking of the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> best kale chips</a>, Jordan put Brad’s Crunchy Kale Chips in the top spot. They come in dark green “nuggets,” as Jordan describes it, and their crunch is unmatched. Plus, these green nugs come coated with a savory seasoning. As Jordan wrote in their review, “The taste is complex, but a little reminiscent of tomato soup.” It really doesn’t taste at all how you would expect a kale chip to tase, in the best way. This is an A+ green snack.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nicos Green Tea Seaweed Snacks</strong></a><p>If you’re a fan of forest green and flavors from the sea, you may want to add seaweed snacks to your green snack lineup. In our <a href=#>best seaweed snack ranking</a>, Danny praised Nicos Green Tea Seaweed Snacks for their complex blend of flavors. “The green tea taste is aromatic and lovely, and there is a pronounced, savory flavor, too. It’s also salty and smoky,” he wrote. Green snack fanatics won’t want to miss out on these.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Green Apple Sour Punch Straws</strong></a><p>In case you were wondering, the answer is, yes, green apple Sour Punch Straws are just as good as you remember them being when you were a child. This candy is the perfect mix of sour, sweet, and chewy, and the green apple flavoring works very well with the sweet-sour combination. I still consider these to be a top-tier movie snack, and a top tier green snack, too. A good number of the licorice-like straws come in a single package, so there will definitely be enough to share.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJ%2BimrKvedKnmJyjXZ6xpq3SaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./freddie-highmore-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Freddie Highmore Net Worth How Much is Highmore Worth?</span></a>
