His black hair and brown eyes stand out against his flawless skin and strong frame.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Drew_Brees_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Drew Brees start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Initially, he planned to play collegiate baseball, but after blowing out his knee, his plans altered. As a sophomore in 1995, he moved to quarterback. He wasn’t your typical quarterback, though; he was shorter and considerably thinner than other quarterbacks. His arm, on the other hand, was the hero; every time he threw, it soared straight, genuine, and powerful.</p><p>During his junior year, he was voted the Most Valuable Offensive Player. His high school football team was undefeated and won the state title. Drew completed 314 of 490 passes (64.1 percent) for 5461 yards and 50 touchdowns. He was on the state high school football all-star squad as well as the All-USA high school football formation.</p><p><strong>College Football</strong></p><p>Drew was a standout as a junior. During his junior and senior years, he was a vital player of Joe Tiller and Jim Chaney’s unusual “basketball on grass” spread offense, serving as offensive captain. Brees was given a slot in the 2000 NFL Draft during his junior year, but elected to finish his studies instead.</p><p>During his undergraduate career, Drew set two NCAA records, 13 Big Ten Conference records, and 19 Purdue University records. With 11792 throwing yards, 90 touchdown passes, 12,693 total offensive yards, 1026 completions, and 1678 attempts, he established multiple records. In 2009, he was inducted into Purdue’s Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Smolsprout, Martin Braithwaite, and Victoria Mercado."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":63}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/smolsprout/"}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":"https://popularbio.com/martin-braithwaite/"}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":"https://popularbio.com/victoria-mercado/"}{"1":63}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Smolsprout</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Martin Braithwaite</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Victoria Mercado</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ryan Poles | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Ryan Poles is a prominent executive in the American Football industry in addition to being a football participant, fan, and supporter.
